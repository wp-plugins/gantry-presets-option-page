Requires at least: 3.0
Tested up to: 3.2.1
Stable tag: 0.1

Adds an option page to apply the desired Preset on the theme. Requires Gantry template framework.

== Description ==

I wanted to give my client a nice and clean way to change the design appearance without giving them the access to the Gantry theme settings page, so I built this. Now you can use Gantry's Presets system and define the presets in the admin page, and your theme users or clients can select and apply one of those on the theme.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the whole plugin directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Now go to Appearances -> Skin and select the preset you want.
4. Enjoy!
